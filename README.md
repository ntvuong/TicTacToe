# TicTacToe
Create a game, which is a variant of the well-known ﬁve-in-a-row game. The two players can play on a board consists of 6x6, 10x10 and 14x14 ﬁelds. Players put their signs alternately (X and O) on the board. A sign can be put only onto a free ﬁeld. The game ends, when the board is full, or a player won by having ﬁve adjacent signs in a row, column or diagonal. The program should show during the game who turns. The trick in this variant is that if a player makes 3 adjacent signs (in a row, column or diagonal), then one of his signs is removed randomly (not necessary from this 3 signs). Similar happens, when the player makes 4 adjacent signs, but in this case two of his signs are removed.
